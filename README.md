# BugTrap

BugTrap is a tool to catch unhandled exceptions in **unmanaged** and **managed** .NET code. BugTrap also supports sending crash reports to a remote server for analysis.

The original author, Maksim Pyatkovskiy, has a great [article about BugTrap on CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14618/Catch-All-Bugs-with-BugTrap) that goes into detail about how BugTrap is used.

The original author's website (and source code) went offline sometime in 2012 ([via WayBack Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20120405043411/http://www.intellesoft.net/downloads.php)). This repository was originally a snapshot of the latest version of the source-code I could find before the author's website disappeared. Since then, many contributors have continued to improve BugTrap.

The original source-code licence for BugTrap is the [GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)](http://web.archive.org/web/20120402075507/http://www.intellesoft.net/bugtrap-license.php?BugTrapSrc.zip). In other words, you're free to use BugTrap in commercial and non-commercial applications.
